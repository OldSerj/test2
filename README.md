## ✨ What is SkillSwap?
SkillSwap is a matching app designed to connect people based on hobbies, passions, and skills. 
Whenever two users have complementary interests, their **cards appear on each other's pages** — enabling them to match, chat, schedule, and collaborate, all of this directly inside the app.

## 🛠️ Demo Stage
We’re actively building and refining:
- **Profile Verification** → Ensuring accounts belong to real humans.  
- **Automated Skill Leveling** → Future integration with video proofs and AI-backed validation.  
- **Deep Profiles** → For now, users explore each other’s profiles to see their skills, but we also plan to implement a depth feature (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). However, that is not directly important because the way the user is perceived will still be primarily related to his ratings.
